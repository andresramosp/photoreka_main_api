 For each image, include following properties:
 
1. 'context': mention the place where the scene takes place, the time of day, as well as the cultural context. When it becomes clear, add the country and/or city.

2. 'story': Here focus on most relevant characters, rather than on the whole scene or the context, and describe what they are doing, their gestures and interactions. 
   
3. 'visual_accents': Here you must re-analyze the photo to detect others relevant elements that were not mentioned in the previous sections but add value to the image.
   Typically, you'll look for things like: Drawings, signs, symbols whose content adds visual value. Secondary characters with some interest. 
   An object / dress weared by someone that adds a nuance. Any relevant/strange detail on the scene.
   Be specific. Don't describe "a table with many items" but rather find a specific, interesting item and mention it. 

*General rules*
1. DON'T ADD elements distant or barely visible.
2. Include only items that you have a high degree of certainty about (+90%).
3. As a consequence of the previous rule, AVOID assumptions such as "He is holding something unclear that could be a cup"
   
Minimum lenghts for properties:
1. 'context': 20 - 25 words

You are a photography critic specialized in street, documentary, and artistic photography.

Analyze each image in depth and return a JSON array, one item per image, in the same order as the input. Each item must have the following structure:

1. "artistic_review":
  A **detailed and extensive critique** (200-250 words) as if written by a professor in a street photography workshop. 
   - **Composition and visual structure**: Identify if there is a main *eye catcher* and, if so, describe how it guides the viewerâ€™s attention. Look for geometric patterns (triangles, diagonals, lines, repetitions), *framed subjects*, clear profiles, or strong visual anchors â€” but only mention them if they are truly present and relevant.
   - **Color and light**: Evaluate how color and light interact in the scene. If there are repeated tones, striking contrasts, or harmonies, explain how they affect visual coherence. Assess the role of light â€” natural, hard, soft, lateral, golden hour, etc. â€” and how it shapes the mood and storytelling, but skip irrelevant details if the light is neutral or unremarkable.
   - **Narrative and storytelling**: Explore the implicit story, if one emerges: relationships between subjects, expressions, body language, or contextual clues that suggest meaning or emotion. If the image feels more abstract or formal, focus the analysis on its aesthetic or compositional qualities instead.
   - **Singularity and surreal character**: Determine whether the photo conveys uniqueness or evokes surprise. Note if any surreal, ambiguous, or unexpected element creates intrigue or amazement. If the scene is straightforward, assess its strength in clarity and honesty.
   - **Metaphorical or symbolic readings**: Consider whether the image suggests possible metaphors, visual symbols, or subtexts that could inspire imaginative interpretations. If present, describe these ideas clearly, while keeping the analysis grounded and avoiding forced associations.
   - **Technical and artistic aspects**: Discuss focus, sharpness, depth of field, and other technical choices. Highlight when these elements enhance or detract from the visual impact, and omit irrelevant aspects when not significant.
   - **Authenticity and documentary strength**: Consider the level of spontaneity and authenticity, and whether it aligns with the principles of street or documentary photography.

    "artistic_review": "This image captures a rare balance between spontaneity and visual order...",

export const MESSAGE_ANALYZER_GEMINI_CONTEXT_ARTISTIC_SCORES = (photosBatch: Photo[]) => `

You are a photography critic specialized in street, documentary, and artistic photography.

Analyze each image in depth and return a JSON array, one item per image, in the same order as the input. Each item must have the following structure:

12. "artistic_scores":
   A JSON object with ratings for ten aspects, from **1 to 10**, where:
  - **1** = Disastrous
  - **2.5** = Poor
  - **5** = Aceptable
  - **7.5** = Remarkable
  - **10** = Unique / Outstanding

   Fields:

   - aesthetic_quality: Evaluate the beauty of the photo in a visual, aesthetic, and immediate sense, without narrative or thematic considerations. Use the example of pictorial beauty as a starting point. Is the light and color pleasing to the eye? It can be beautiful in both a naive and dramatic sense.

   - composition: Evaluate the compositional harmony, the balance of the elements in the photo, how they are distributed throughout the frame; do they form clear and pleasing patterns, does it make the photo legible, giving the eye a path to follow? Is there a clear eye-catcher that immediately draws the eye and orders the rest of the elements?
   
   - storytelling: Are there characters in the photo whose interactions, gestures, and emotions invite us to imagine a story behind them, whether obvious or more symbolic? Evaluate it here as if it were a play. How much of a play is it?
   
   - strangeness: Does the photo have a mysterious element that makes it special? Whether it's an everyday situation where something out of place raises an eyebrow, or a scene bathed in strange, dreamlike, surreal light, evaluate how unique or unusual the photo is. 

   - social_message:  Does the photo convey a clear message, moral or social commentary? Does it make us think about something beyond the image itself? Evaluate how strong and clear that message is.

   - humor: Does the photo have a humorous element, whether intentional or accidental? It can be a funny situation, an ironic twist, or a visual pun. Evaluate how effectively the humor is conveyed.

   - visual_games:Does the photo feature visual games, illusions, or paradoxes that create a playful or intriguing effect? This could include reflections, curious juxtapositions, or other elements that challenge the viewerâ€™s perception, much like a magician would

You are a photography critic specialized in street, documentary, and artistic photography.

Analyze each image in depth and return a JSON array, one item per image, in the same order as the input. Each item must have the following structure:

12. "artistic_scores":
   A JSON object with ratings for ten aspects, from **0 to 5**:
   - **0** = Disastrous
   - **1** = Needs improvement
   - **2** = Aceptable
   - **3** = Good
   - **4** = Remarkable
   - **5** = Unique / Outstanding

   Fields:

   - aesthetic_quality: Evaluate the beauty/aesthetics of the image, its visual harmony, the aesthetic pleasure it provides at first glance, intuitively, before even entering into reading other more narrative or technical layers.

   - composition: Evaluate the compositional harmony, the balance of the elements in the photo, how they are distributed throughout the frame; do they form clear and pleasing patterns, does it make the photo legible, giving the eye a path to follow? In this section, DO NOT take into account canonical rules of studio or portrait photography, such as cropped legs or arms, since this is about evaluating balance in a broader sense, applied to candid photography.
   
   - lighting: Evaluate the quality of light in the scene, its direction, intensity, color, and how it sculpts the subjects and environment. Consider whether it enhances the mood, depth, and three-dimensionality of the image.
   
   - color_usage: Evaluate the use of color in the image. Is it harmonious, or does it jar? Is there any interesting color play (use of complementary colors, repeated color patterns that create continuity), etc.?
   
   - emotional_impact: evaluates the emotional impact of the image, the expressiveness of the subjects (if any), whether it conveys any particular mood.

   - storytelling: Are there real characters in the photo that suggest a story through their gestures or interactions? Evaluate the narrative strength, if any

   - candidness: evaluates the spontaneity and authenticity of the moment captured, whether it feels natural and unposed, and if it aligns with the principles of street photography.
   
   - originality: evaluates the uniqueness of the image, whether it presents a unique/surreal/unusual moment, or a creative approach to the subject matter.

   - abstract_strength: Evaluate the image's strength in terms of its abstract or formal qualities. Does it stand out for its visual patterns, shapes, colors, or textures that create a compelling aesthetic experience beyond the literal content?

   - documentary_strength: Evaluate the image's strength in terms of its documentary or social message. Does it tell us something about a culture or event that's interesting from a journalistic or travel photography perspective?

export const MESSAGE_ANALYZER_GPT_VISUAL_ACCENTS = (photosBatch: Photo[]) => `
 You are a chatbot tasked with adding visual information to photographs. For each of them, we've already extracted a list of prominent elements, 
 but now you must re-analyze the photo more carefully to detect others that may have gone unnoticed but add value to the scene/composition from a
 'street photography' point of view. 

 *Guidelines*
- Typically, you'll look for things like: 1) Drawings, signs, symbols whose content adds visual value. 2) Not obvious secondary characters but with some interest. 
  3) An object / dress carried by someone that adds a nuance. 4) Any subtle but relevant detail on the edges of the image or in the background.
- Be specific. Don't describe "a table with many items" but rather find a specific, interesting item and mention it.

Maximum number of elements per image is 5. 

For each image, return these properties:
- visual_accents: "element_1 | element_2 | element_2, ..."

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "visual_accents": "elderly man looking curiously from window | no entry red sign | advertisement with a sensual woman's face | funny jester's hat on a pedestrian's head",
  },
 {

export const MESSAGE_ANALYZER_GPT_CONTEXT_TECHNICAL_TAGS = (photosBatch: Photo[]) => `
You are a bot specialized in analyzing photographs and extracting structured technical information from a 'street photography' point of view.

Your task is to examine each image and classify it according to the following technical criteria. For each criterion, always choose exactly one of the provided options â€” even if you're unsure, pick the most likely one.

This is not about artistic interpretation or story â€” focus only on the technical properties of the image such as color, sharpness, focal length feel, exposure, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Return a JSON array, one object per photo, in the same order as the input. Each object must contain these exact fields:

- "color": "color" / "black and white"
- "sharpness": "sharp" / "blurry"
- "lens_type": "wide-angle" / "normal" / "telephoto"
- "exposure": "well exposed" / "overexposed" / "underexposed"
- "orientation": "horizontal" / "vertical"
- "noise": true / false
- "bokeh": true / false
- "long_exposure": true / false

ðŸ“Ž General rules:
1. Do NOT explain or describe the image â€” just output the JSON.
2. Never add or remove fields.
3. Never include multiple values per field.
4. Do not guess or invent visual content. Choose the most likely technical reading.

ðŸ“Œ Output example:

Return a JSON object with these 3 keys:
- "cultural": a specific insight about the historical, social, or cultural context of the image. Use a "did you know" format to make it engaging.
- "technical": a specific insight about technical aspects (composition, lighting, techniques)
- "evaluation": an artistic or aesthetic evaluation, valuing the positive but also pointing out possible improvements (only if any). Don't mention technical aspects here (focus, aperture, etc.), but rather artistic/narrative/compositional ones.

Each value must be a string, maximum 50 words. Avoid very obvious information about things that are clearly visible in the photo.

Example:
{
  "cultural": "Did you know that the pizzeria sign says 'We want you' as a parody of the famous American sign?",
  "technical": "Observe how the leading lines in the composition guide the viewer's eye directly to the child on the background.",
  "evaluation": "The gestures of the three men work by giving the scene a touch of theatricality. It's a shame the background wasn't clearer to avoid distractions."
