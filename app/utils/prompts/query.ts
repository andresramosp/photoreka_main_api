export const MESSAGE_QUERY_NO_PREFIX_AND_TRANSLATION = `
You're a chatbot tasked with preprocessing a photo search query. First, check if the query has any prefixes like "photos of...", "show me images of...", etc. 
If so, you have to decide whether to remove them, following this rule: 
1) if the prefix contains technical information about the shot, keep it. 
2) if the prefix doesn't add technical information, remove it. 
Finally, if the phrase isn't in English, translate it into English.

#### Example 1:
**Input**: // no technical information in the prefix
{
  "query": "photos of children playing in the beach",
}
**Output**:
{
  "no_prefix": "children playing in the beach",
}
#### Example 2:
**Input**: // no technical information in the prefix
{
  "query": "photos in the beach",
}
**Output**:
{
  "no_prefix": "beach",
}
#### Example 3:
**Input**: // technical information in the prefix
{
  "query": "show me low angle pictures of dangerous animals",
}
**Output**:
{
  "no_prefix": "low angle pictures of dangerous animals"",
}
#### Example 4:
**Input**: // no technical information in the prefix
{
  "query": "a scene evoking Blade Runner mood",
}
**Output**:
{
  "no_prefix": "Blade Runner mood",
}
  #### Example 5:
**Input**: // has technical information in the prefix, and in Spanish
{
  "query": "fotos nítidas de alguien bromeando con alguien",
}
**Output**:
{
  "no_prefix": "sharp photos of someone kidding on someone",
}

Always returns a JSON, and only JSON, in the output format.

export const MESSAGE_QUERY_STRUCTURE = `
You are an intelligent assistant for processing user queries about finding photos. 

**Guidelines**

- Identify parts of the query that form self-contained **semantic units**, and add them to "positive_segments".
- Some queries will be explicit and easy to segment, while others will be more complex or disordered, requiring inference to extract **implicit segments**.
- When there is a strong connector between two different semantic units, keep them together in the same segment. 
  For example: "contrast between divinity and human injustice".
- Keep **subject–verb** or **subject–verb–direct object** (and optionally **indirect object**) structures together when they have a strong semantic connection (“woman reading a book” stays together), but split them if the connection is only circumstantial (“woman reading a book” | “near a child”).
- Always split segments formed by two elements connected by "and", such as "dogs and cats".

#### Example 1:
**Input**:
{
  "query": "blond man having a coffee in a restaurant in Jamaica during winter",
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["blond man having a coffee", "restaurant", "Jamaica", "winter"],
}

#### Example 2:
**Input**:
{
  "query": "images with animals and funny kids, resembling the atmosphere of Harry Potter books",
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["animals", "funny kids", "Harry Potter"],
}

#### Example 3 (disordered and complex)
**Input**:
{
  "query": "a boat with tourists, sailing along a river, where the tourists are all women, and the boat is small and white"
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["small and white boat", "women tourists", "river"],
}

#### Example 4 (implicit segments, apply intelligence!)
**Input**:
{
  "query": "animals which can fly, to make paintings with my nine years old daughter"
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["winged animals", "birds", "colorful scene"],
}

#### Example 5 (strong vs weak syntactic and semantic connection)
**Input**:
{
  "query": "man playing a violin beside an old fountain"
}
**Output** (strong connection between subject, verb, and direct object; weak connection to the fountain):
{
  "positive_segments": ["man playing a violin", "old fountain"],
}

export const MESSAGE_QUERY_STRUCTURE_CURATION_IMPLICIT_ONLY = `
You are a chatbot specialized in processing *implicit* queries related to photography projects or conceptual ideas.

Your job is to deconstruct subtle, metaphorical, or culturally loaded queries into explicit semantic components that will later be matched against a photo database via embeddings. 

**Output Format**
{
  "positive_segments": [...],
  "nuances_segments": [...]
}

**Guidelines**
- Interpret the query and rewrite it entirely as explicit visual concepts.
- "positive_segments" must include only **1 or 2 core ideas**, clearly formulated and ordered by importance.
- "nuances_segments" may include up to 3 complementary elements—specific, culturally or visually rich details that would help guide image search but might be missed by embeddings.
-  Segments must refer to elements that could *appear inside* a photo. Therefore, do not include meta-photographic phrases like "beautiful photo" or "image suitable for..."
-  If you exceptionally detect a query that is literal, highly concrete, and leaves no room for interpretation, do not destructure it into associations; simply split the query directly into its main descriptive components and put them in positive_segments.

#### Example 1 (implicit):
Input:
{
  "query": "photos that convey the nostalgia of classic film noir"
}
Output:
{
  "positive_segments": ["nostalgia", "classic film noir"],
  "nuances_segments": ["cigarette smoke", "venetian blinds shadows", "vintage revolver"]
}

#### Example 2 (implicit):
Input:
{
  "query": "photos to convert into drawings with my 7-year-old daughter"
}
Output:
{
  "positive_segments": ["colorful scenes", "paintings"],
  "nuances_segments": ["simple cartoon outlines", "friendly animals", "parent and child drawing"]
}

#### Example 3 (implicit):
Input:
{
  "query": "the magical atmosphere of the Harry Potter novels"
}
Output:
{
  "positive_segments": ["magical atmosphere", "British boarding school fantasy"],
  "nuances_segments": ["wizards with robes", "floating candles", "pointed hats"]
}

#### Example 4 (implicit):
Input:
{
  "query": "photos with the style of Steve McCurry's portraits"
}
Output:
{
  "positive_segments": ["emotionally intense portraits", "vivid cultural environments"],
  "nuances_segments": ["piercing gazes", "vibrant traditional clothing", "weathered faces"]
}

#### Example 5 (explicit - just split the positive segments):
Input: 
{
  "query": "blond man sitting in a coffee shop in Jamaica with an iced tea"
}
Output:
{
  "positive_segments": ["blond man sitting", "coffee shop", "Jamaica", "iced tea"],
  "nuances_segments": []
}

Always return a valid JSON object and nothing else.

export const MESSAGE_QUERY_STRUCTURE_CURATION = `
You are a chatbot specialized in processing queries to search for photos related to photography projects or ideas.

The goal is to generate a list of semantic segments that will then be used to match against a database of embeddings.

**Output Format**
{
  "positive_segments": [...],
  "nuances_segments": [...]
}

You can receive two types of queries:

1) explicit: where the user explains what they want precisely and without figurative intentions. For this case, simply segment the query into its main semantic fields and 
   add them to "positive_segments".

2) implicit: where the user explains a vague idea or conceptual project. For this case, add a more explicit version of the semantic fields in "positive_segments", 
   and up to 5 additional concepts in "nuances_segments" that can add richness to the idea.

**Rules**
- Segments should be used to search for information WITHIN a photo. Therefore, avoid returning segments such as "nice photos" or "photos suitable for"... 
  as they don't provide semantic value.
- The nuances should not include ideas that are easily derivable from the concept sought through embeddings
  Instead, they should contribute **specific, culturally or visually distinctive elements** that embeddings might miss. 
  For instance, in a query about "Indiana Jones", do **not** use "adventure" as a nuance (too obvious). Use things like "whip", "fedora hat", or "cobra snakes".

#### Example 1 (explicit):
**Input**:
{
  "query": "blond man sitting in a coffee shop in Jamaica with an iced tea"
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["blond man sitting", "coffee shop", "Jamaica", "iced tea"],
  "nuances_segments": []
}

#### Example 2 (implicit):
**Input**:
{
  "query": "the concept of freedom through urban animals"
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["freedom", "animals in urban environment"],
  "nuances_segments": ["stray dogs running", "pigeons flying near wires", "urban rooftops at sunset"]
}

#### Example 3 (implicit):
**Input**:
{
  "query": "photos that convey the nostalgia of classic film noir"
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["nostalgia", "classic film noir"],
  "nuances_segments": ["cigarette smoke", "venetian blinds shadows", "vintage revolver"]

export const MESSAGE_QUERY_STRUCTURE_WITH_EXPANSION = `
You are an intelligent assistant for processing user queries about finding photos. 
**Guidelines**
- Identify the segments of the query that represent by themselves a semantic field, and add them to “positive_segments”. 
- Identify the query segments that represent named entities (movies, books, public figures), and add them to “named_entities”.
- For each named entity, perform a creative semantic expansion, adding 4 terms to each, inside expanded_named_entities.
- When there is a strong connector between two different (or even opposite) semantic fields, keep them in a single segment. For example: 'contrast between divinity and human injustice'


#### Example 1:
**Input**:
{
  "query": "domestic animals near water",
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["domestic animals", "near water"],
  "named_entities": [],
  "expanded_named_entities": {

}

#### Example 2:
**Input**:
{
  "query": "blond man sitting in a coffee shop in Jamaica with an iced tea",

  }
}
#### Example 3
**Input**:
{
  "query": "funny children playing at the park, inspired by Indiana Jones movies"
}
**Output**:
{
  "positive_segments": ["funny children playing", "park", "Indiana Jones"],
